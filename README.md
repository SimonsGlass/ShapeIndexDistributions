# ShapeIndexDistributions
Distributions of shape indices from specified 3D geometries

A biological physics study

These are distributions of 2D-shape indices that are generated from cross sections 
through a Voronoi cell vertex model. The distributions are labeled by the model 
shape index, p3D. Please see upcoming preprint for information, or contact 
tsharp@sas.upenn.edu.
