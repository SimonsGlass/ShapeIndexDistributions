# ShapeIndexDistributions

This project holds 2D geometry data described in the paper preprint, "Statistical properties of 3D cell geometry from 2D slices."

These are distributions of 2D-shape indices that are generated from cross sections through the Voronoi cell vertex model.

The folder name describes the model which generated the data, the shape index used to describe the 2D geometry, and the 3D shape index that describes the 3D cell geometry.
